## Milestone 2&alpha; feedback
I see you have a start in the right direction, but I'm concerned that the wireframes you've created are not detailed enough to provide you with a guide for your HTML and CSS development. 

The wireframes should be detailed enough to show the container structure and the outlines of the UI elements you need to build. I would continue to work on these before you begin building your PWP. Put a bit more detail into each section:

 - What content will go in your Header and Footer?
 - Will you feature navigation of any kind?
 - Will you format your content into rows and columns?
 - How do you plan to place the pictures of your work?  
 - Where will the contact form go?

I recommend that you think about using some rows and columns in your full screen layout. Content that spans the entire width of a full screen is generally way too wide to be effective.

We will cover how to create flexible, responsive columns using Bootstrap in class this week. I strongly recommend you do the CSS and Bootstrap practice exercises I will be going over this week. 

There are also a few errors in your HTML. See Edits and Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). I strongly recommend that you work with the wireframes more before you begin building your PWP.
 
### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag is missing
- `<ui>` tag is incorrect. Use `<p>` tags or `<ul>` and `<li>` tags instead.

## Milestone 2&beta; Feedback
Detailed notes on our meeting have been sent via Slack. You have some work to do, so stay focused and you should be able to finish PWP in a matter of hours. Many of the issues are simply CSS related, and also get your real content on the page. Get your contact form built by Thursday AM if you want to follow along with the class demo on getting the PHP mailer working. Your Milestone 2b passes at Tier II.
