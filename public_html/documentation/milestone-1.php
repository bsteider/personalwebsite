			<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>I want my PWP to show me as a coder. How good I will be, what I bring to the table, and overall act as a type of resume. Beyond that I want to do all kinds of work on it to explore what different possibilites I can have making a website and see how creative I can get with it. I want it to be my first accomplishment in the class.</p>
			<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>Primarily I want my PWP to be viewed by potential employers or customers. If i start working for someone they should know what kind of work I am capable of creating. That goes as well for customers if I do freelance work. They should be able to see that I know what i'm doing and can make all kinds of different things. </p>
			<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>My goal is to aquire a full time job.</p>
