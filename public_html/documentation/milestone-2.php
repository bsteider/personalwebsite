		<h2>Content</h2>
		<ui>Links/pictures of my previous projects and work</ui>
		<ul>Information about who I am</ul>
		<ui>The skills I have as a web developer </ui>
		<ui>What I plan to acheive as a web developer</ui>
		<ui>Ways to contact me</ui>
		<h2>Purpose of content</h2>
		<ui>I decided to choose four main points for my content. I want to keep it short and sweet, but look good and have the important information. I want my work on there to show potential employers who what sort of stuff I can create. The purpose of the "who I am" is to give them a general idea of what kind of person I am. The skills tell people what i'm able to create, what languages I can code, and basically cover the work I do. The last section will state what my plans are, like if I want to persue a career in this field, start my own company, etc.</ui>
